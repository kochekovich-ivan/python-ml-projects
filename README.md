Work with **NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and PyTorch**.

---

## Structure
- `src/` — Python scripts organized by topic  
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies for reproducibility  

---

## Current Progress
- `intro_numpy.py` — basics of numerical computing with NumPy  

---

## How to Run
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kochekovich-ivan/python-ml-projects.git
cd python-ml-projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
